Features with High Multicollinearity\n","\n","\n","When features are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to isolate the individual effect of each variable on the target variable and the relationship between features and the target will be difficult to interpret. This leads to challenges in understanding which variables are mostly responsible for the outcome. Models with high multicollinearity also lead to high variance which means that the model is highly sensitive to the training data and can produce large changes in predictions with small changes in the dataset, increasing the likelihood of overfitting as the model cannot capture a more general pattern and is instead too tailored for the training data.\n","\n","\n","\n","Note the error message below, \n","\"divide by zero encountered in scalar divide, vif = 1. / (1. - r_squared_i)\"\n","\n","This means that R^2 is equal to 1, so the feature being evaluated is perfectly predicted by other features (perfect multicollinearity).

For example, if a fighter has a 0.2 average for significant strikes, it indicates that 20% of their strikes are significant. However, this average can be very misleading.

More trees will lead to a more accurate model, however it will also be more computationally expensive and the growth in accuracy will eventually plateau.\n","\n","- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of the decision trees from root to leaf to help control complexity. A higher depth will lead to a more accurate model, but it can also lead to the tree capturing noise and small changes leading to overfitting the data, and of course, more computing power is needed for deeper trees. A lower depth will lead to decisions based on less splits and will be less complex, so less likely to overfit and instead become more generalized, but can also lead to underfitting.  \n","- **min_samples_split**: Minimum number of samples required to split a node in a decision tree. A higher number of samples will help stop the creation of nodes that are too specific, which can lead to overfitting. Also, a high value means that nodes require a large number of samples to make a split which results in fewer splits and therefore a low depth tree. A low number of samples lets nodes split even with few samples, creating deeper trees.\n","- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node. A high number of samples lead to low trees because they will have to have a lot of samples in each leaf, preventing the trees to capture patterns and leading to underfitting. A low number of samples will lead to trees growing deeper with smaller leaf nodes, capturing more detailed patterns but also potential overfitting. Integer values means # of samples, while float values means % of samples.\n","- **max_features**: Number of features that are considered when splitting a node in a decision tree. Limiting the number of features creates diversity with the trees in the forest which helps improve the generalization and reduces overfitting. High values will result in each tree having access to most of the features, leading to accurate trees but might reduce the generalization and leads to overfitting. Low values results in each tree seeing a small set of features, increasing generalization  but less accurate trees and potential underfitting. Integer values means # of features, while float values mean % of features\n","\n","\n","Random Forests are less affected by multicollinearity as it randomly select a subset of features for each tree split. This random selection reduces the impact of multicollinearity because each tree is not affected by all features simultaneously. However as seen above, many of the features were highly correlated with each other so a lot of the features selected will affect the model performance. In the presence of multicollinearity, feature importance scores might not clearly reflect the true importance of features because correlated features may share importance. Random Forests might assign importance to multiple correlated features rather than isolating the contribution of each.\n","\n","\n","\n","Other Models: For other models like linear regression or logistic regression, multicollinearity can be a bigger issue and might need more attention.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"29a40231","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-08T14:18:45.782223Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-08T14:18:45.781703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-08T14:18:46.715055Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-08T14:18:46.71388Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.954624,"end_time":"2024-08-08T14:18:46.717624","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-08T14:18:45.763","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Accuracy: 0.85\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n","from skopt import BayesSearchCV\n","from skopt.space import Real, Integer\n","\n","\n","# parameter grid for Grid Search and Random Search\n","# parameter_grid = {\n","#     'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150],        \n","#     'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],       \n","#     'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],    \n","#     'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],    \n","#     'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2']  \n","# }\n","\n","\n","# #
