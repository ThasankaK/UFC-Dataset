For example, if a fighter has a 0.2 average for significant strikes, it indicates that 20% of their strikes are significant. However, this average can be very misleading. A fighter who has achieved 1 significant strike out of 5 attempts and another who has achieved 10 significant strikes out of 50 both have the same average of 0.2. \n","\n","\n","The volume of attempts is critical in a fight. Averages alone do not account for the number of attempts, which can greatly influence the performance of fighters. Using normalized averages alone can oversimplify the data and fail to capture the true effectiveness or consistency of a fighter's performance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"11d8f992","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-06T07:04:04.868458Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-06T07:04:04.868009Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.759254Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.757881Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.909417,"end_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.762773","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:04.853356","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/d/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024/ufc_fighters_avg.csv\n","/kaggle/input/d/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024/ufc_event_fight_stats.csv\n","/kaggle/input/d/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024/ufc_fighters_median.csv\n","/kaggle/input/d/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024/ufc_fighters.csv\n","/kaggle/input/d/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024/ufc_events.csv\n"]}],"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n","\n","import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n","# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44e389ea","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013211,"end_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.789082","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.775871","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Event Fights Data Cleaning and Preprocessing"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"80757530","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013091,"end_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.815328","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.802237","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Converting 'result' Section of Data\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fd38707b","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.012581,"end_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.841699","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-06T07:04:05.829118","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["\n","Cleaning the 'result' section of the data by removing any matches labeled as 'nc' (no contest), as these represent fights that ended under problematic situations.
